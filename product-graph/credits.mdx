# Credits Management

The ProductGraph API uses a credit-based system to provide flexibility while maintaining fair usage. This page explains how credits work, how they're consumed, and how to manage them effectively.

<Note>
Credits are separate from your API rate limits. While rate limits control how many requests you can make in a time period, credits determine the total volume of operations you can perform.
</Note>

## Credit Consumption

Different API operations consume varying amounts of credits based on their complexity and resource requirements. Here's a breakdown of credit costs for common operations:

## Credit Add-On Packs

Need additional credits? You can purchase add-on packs as needed:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Small Pack" icon="box" color="#4F46E5">
    5,000 credits for $79 (1.6¢ per credit)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Medium Pack" icon="boxes-stacked" color="#4F46E5">
    25,000 credits for $299 (1.2¢ per credit)

## Best Practices for Credit Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Your Credit Usage">
    Regularly check your credit balance and usage patterns to avoid unexpected depletion. Set up alerts when your credits fall below a certain threshold.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Implement Caching">
    Cache API responses when appropriate to reduce redundant API calls. This is especially useful for product data that doesn't change frequently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Batch Operations">
    Whenever possible, use batch operations to process multiple items in a single request, which typically offers credit discounts compared to individual operations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Optimize Search Queries">
    Make your search queries as specific as possible to reduce the number of results that need processing, which can save credits in the long run.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Plan for Seasonal Volume">
    If your business has seasonal spikes, consider purchasing add-on packs before high-volume periods or temporarily upgrading your subscription.
