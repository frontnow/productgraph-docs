# Authentication & Rate Limiting

This guide explains how to authenticate your requests to the Product Graph API and understand the rate limits that apply to your account.

## Authentication Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="API Key Authentication">
    Access to the ProductGraph API requires authentication for most operations. While some basic endpoints are available anonymously, full functionality requires an API key.

    Pass your unique API key via the `X-API-Key` header in all your requests:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/products" \
      -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
    ```

    <Tip>
      Keep your API key secure! Don't share it or expose it in client-side code. Use environment variables or secrets management to store API keys in your applications.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="OAuth (Coming Soon)">
    OAuth authentication will be available in a future release for more advanced integration scenarios. This will allow:

    - User-specific permissions
    - Granular access control
    - Token refresh capabilities
    - Third-party integrations

    <Note>
      Sign up for our developer newsletter to be notified when OAuth authentication becomes available.

## Obtaining an API Key

To get your API key:

1. Sign up for an account at [dashboard.productgraph.org](https://dashboard.productgraph.org)
2. Navigate to the "API Keys" section
3. Create a new API key with the appropriate permissions
4. Copy the key securely - it will only be shown once

<Warning>
  Never share your API key publicly or commit it to version control systems. Use environment variables or secrets management solutions to store your keys securely.
</Warning>

## Rate Limits

We implement fair usage policies to ensure reliable service for all users.

### Rate Limit Headers

All responses include rate limit headers to help you monitor your usage:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 2023-04-15T16:00:00Z
```

These headers provide:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Your total request allowance
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Number of requests remaining in the current period
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets (ISO 8601 format)

### Handling Rate Limit Errors

If you exceed your rate limit, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code:

```json
{
  "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
  "message": "You have exceeded your rate limit. Please try again after the reset time.",
  "reset_at": "2023-04-15T16:00:00Z"
}
```

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript JavaScript
  async function makeApiRequest(endpoint) {
    try {
      const response = await fetch(`https://api.productgraph.org/v1/${endpoint}`, {
        headers: {
          'X-API-Key': process.env.PRODUCT_GRAPH_API_KEY
        }
      });
      
      if (response.status === 429) {
        const data = await response.json();
        const resetTime = new Date(data.reset_at);
        const waitTime = resetTime - new Date();
        console.log(`Rate limit exceeded. Retrying after ${waitTime}ms`);
        
        // Wait until reset time and try again
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, waitTime));
        return makeApiRequest(endpoint);
      }
      
      return await response.json();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('API request failed:', error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  ```

  ```python Python
  import requests
  import time
  from datetime import datetime, timezone
  import os

  def make_api_request(endpoint):
      api_key = os.environ.get('PRODUCT_GRAPH_API_KEY')
      headers = {'X-API-Key': api_key}
      
      response = requests.get(f"https://api.productgraph.org/v1/{endpoint}", headers=headers)
      
      if response.status_code == 429:
          data = response.json()
          reset_time = datetime.fromisoformat(data['reset_at'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
          wait_time = (reset_time - datetime.now(timezone.utc)).total_seconds()
          print(f"Rate limit exceeded. Retrying after {wait_time} seconds")
          
          # Wait until reset time and try again
          time.sleep(wait_time)
          return make_api_request(endpoint)
          
      return response.json()
  ```

  ```ruby Ruby
  require 'net/http'
  require 'json'
  require 'time'

  def make_api_request(endpoint)
    api_key = ENV['PRODUCT_GRAPH_API_KEY']
    uri = URI("https://api.productgraph.org/v1/#{endpoint}")
    
    request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
    request['X-API-Key'] = api_key
    
    response = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
      http.request(request)
    end
    
    if response.code.to_i == 429
      data = JSON.parse(response.body)
      reset_time = Time.parse(data['reset_at'])
      wait_time = reset_time - Time.now
      puts "Rate limit exceeded. Retrying after #{wait_time} seconds"
      
      # Wait until reset time and try again
      sleep(wait_time)
      return make_api_request(endpoint)
    end
    
    JSON.parse(response.body)
  end
  ```

## Best Practices

To optimize your API usage and avoid rate limit issues:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement Caching">
    Cache API responses when appropriate to reduce the number of requests needed. Consider caching data that doesn't change frequently.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Exponential Backoff">
    When encountering rate limit errors, implement exponential backoff with jitter to avoid creating traffic spikes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Monitor Your Usage">
    Regularly check your API usage through our dashboard to ensure you're on the appropriate plan for your needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Batch Requests When Possible">
    Some endpoints support batch operations. Use these when possible to reduce the number of API calls needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle Rate Limit Headers">
    Proactively monitor the rate limit headers and throttle your requests before hitting limits.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Next Steps

Now that you understand how to authenticate with the API and manage rate limits, learn about managing your credits and costs:
