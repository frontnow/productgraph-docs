# Best Practices

## Language Handling
- Always specify which languages you need to minimize response size and optimize performance.
- Use language priority lists (`languages=de,en,fr`) to ensure sensible fallbacks.
- When displaying product attributes, use the localized keys (`key` field) and values for a better user experience.

## Performance Optimization
- Use selective loading (`fields=description,attributes,images`) to minimize response size.
- Implement caching strategies based on the `updated_at` timestamps.
- Use asynchronous APIs for resource-intensive operations like search.

## Translation Management
- Prioritize translation of the most important fields (name, description, key attributes).
- Monitor translation status with the `include_translation_status=true` parameter when needed.
- Use webhooks to receive notifications when translations are completed.
