## Version 1.6.0

<Update label="April 15, 2023" description="v1.6.0">
### Multilingual Content Quality Scoring
  We've added quality scoring for multilingual content, allowing you to identify which translated content needs improvement.
  
  ```json
  {
    "name": {
      "en": {
        "value": "Wireless Bluetooth Headphones",
        "quality_score": 0.98
      },
      "de": {
        "value": "Kabellose Bluetooth-Kopfhörer",
        "quality_score": 0.95
      },
      "fr": {
        "value": "Écouteurs Bluetooth sans fil",
        "quality_score": 0.92
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  
  Quality scores range from 0.0 to 1.0, with higher values indicating better quality.
</Update>

<Update label="April 12, 2023" description="v1.6.0">
### Advanced Filter Operators in Search API
  Search filters now support advanced operators including range queries, negation, and OR conditions.
  
  ```javascript
  // Search for products between $50-$200, excluding specific brands
  const searchData = {
    query: "bluetooth speaker",
    filter: {
      price: {
        $gte: 50,
        $lte: 200
      },
      brand: {
        $nin: ["BrandX", "BrandY"]
      },
      attributes: {
        $or: [
          { waterproof: true },
          { water_resistant: true }
        ]
      }
    }
  };
  ```
  
  This enables much more precise filtering for complex product searches.
</Update>

## Version 1.5.0

<Update label="March 22, 2023" description="v1.5.0">
### Historical Data API
  Introducing our new Historical Data API that allows you to track changes to product information over time.

  # Get historical versions of a product
  curl -X GET "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/products/prod_123/history" \
    -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"

      "average_quality_score": 0.87,

        {"name": "Cameras", "count": 126}
      ]
    }
  }
  ```
  
  This data can help you understand brand presence and product coverage across categories.
</Update>

## Version 1.4.0

<Update label="February 10, 2023" description="v1.4.0">
### Enhanced Webhook Reliability
  We've completely rebuilt our webhook delivery system with:
  
  - Guaranteed delivery with automatic retries
  - Delivery metrics and logs in the dashboard
  - Event filtering for more precise notifications
  - Webhook signature verification for enhanced security
  
  ```bash
  # Create a webhook with event filtering
  curl -X POST "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/webhooks" \
    -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://your-server.com/webhook",
      "events": ["product.created", "product.updated.description"],
      "secret": "your-signing-secret"
    }'
  ```
  
  Webhooks now show delivery status and history in the dashboard.
</Update>

<Update label="February 8, 2023" description="v1.4.0">
### Bulk Operations API
  New endpoints for high-volume operations:
  
  ```bash
  # Bulk fetch products
  curl -X POST "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/products/bulk/get" \
    -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
      "ids": ["prod_123", "prod_456", "prod_789"],
      "languages": ["en", "de"]
    }'
  ```
  
  Bulk operations are processed asynchronously and significantly reduce API call overhead for large datasets. Available for product retrieval, search operations, and translations.
