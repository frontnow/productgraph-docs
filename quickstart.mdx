# Product Graph API Quickstart

This guide will help you get up and running with the Product Graph API in just a few minutes. Follow these steps to authenticate, make your first API calls, and start building your integration.

## Step 1: Get API Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an account">
    Visit the [Product Graph Dashboard](https://dashboard.productgraph.org) and sign up for an account if you don't already have one.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose a plan">
    Select a plan that fits your needs. We offer various tiers from free developer plans to enterprise solutions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate an API key">
    In your dashboard, navigate to the "API Keys" section and click "Generate New Key".
    
    <Note>
      Keep your API key secure! Don't expose it in client-side code or public repositories.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Make Your First API Call

Let's try a simple API call to verify your setup. We'll retrieve the details of your API account and credits.

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/credits" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const apiKey = "your-api-key";

fetch("https://api.productgraph.org/v1/credits", {
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": apiKey
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log("Credits information:", data))
.catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```

```python Python
import requests

api_key = "your-api-key"
url = "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/credits"
headers = {"X-API-Key": api_key}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()
print(f"Credits information: {data}")
```
</CodeGroup>

You should receive a response like this:

```json
{
  "total_credits": 1000,
  "used_credits": 0,
  "remaining_credits": 1000,
  "plan": "Developer",
  "credits_reset_at": "2023-05-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

## Step 3: Search for Products

Now let's try something more useful - searching for products. This example shows how to perform a basic search query:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/search" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "wireless headphones",
    "languages": ["en", "de"],
    "filter": {
      "brand": "Sony"
    }
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const searchData = {
  query: "wireless headphones",
  languages: ["en", "de"],
  filter: {
    brand: "Sony"
  }
};

fetch("https://api.productgraph.org/v1/search", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": apiKey,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(searchData)
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log("Search job initiated:", data);
  // Note: This is an asynchronous job, you'll need to check the results later
  // using the job_id from the response
})
.catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

search_data = {
    "query": "wireless headphones",
    "languages": ["en", "de"],
    "filter": {
        "brand": "Sony"
    }
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/search",
    headers={"X-API-Key": api_key, "Content-Type": "application/json"},
    data=json.dumps(search_data)
)

data = response.json()
print(f"Search job initiated: {data}")
# Note: This is an asynchronous job, you'll need to check the results later
# using the job_id from the response
```
</CodeGroup>

You'll receive a response with a job ID for the search request:

```json
{
  "job_id": "srch_12345",
  "status": "queued",
  "created_at": "2023-04-14T10:30:22Z"
}
```

## Step 4: Retrieve Search Results

Since search operations are processed asynchronously for complex queries, you'll need to check the status of the job and retrieve the results:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X GET "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/search/srch_12345" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const jobId = "srch_12345"; // Use the job_id from the previous response

fetch(`https://api.productgraph.org/v1/search/${jobId}`, {
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": apiKey
  }
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log("Search results:", data))
.catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```

```python Python
job_id = "srch_12345"  # Use the job_id from the previous response

response = requests.get(
    f"https://api.productgraph.org/v1/search/{job_id}",
    headers={"X-API-Key": api_key}
)

results = response.json()
print(f"Search results: {results}")
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step 5: Implement Webhooks (Optional)

For production applications, instead of polling for search results, you can set up webhooks to be notified when asynchronous operations complete:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.productgraph.org/v1/webhooks" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://your-callback-url.com/webhook",
    "events": ["search_completed", "product_updated"],
    "secret": "your-webhook-secret"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const webhookData = {
  url: "https://your-callback-url.com/webhook",
  events: ["search_completed", "product_updated"],
  secret: "your-webhook-secret"
};

fetch("https://api.productgraph.org/v1/webhooks", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "X-API-Key": apiKey,
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(webhookData)
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => console.log("Webhook created:", data))
.catch(error => console.error("Error:", error));
```
</CodeGroup>
