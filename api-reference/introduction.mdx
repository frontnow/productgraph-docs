# API Reference

This section provides detailed reference documentation for all endpoints in the Product Graph API. Each endpoint includes request parameters, response formats, and example code to help you integrate with our API effectively.

## API Base URLs

The Product Graph API is available at the following base URLs:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Production
https://api.productgraph.org/v1
```

```bash Sandbox
https://sandbox.productgraph.org/v1
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Use the sandbox environment for testing and development purposes. It provides a safe environment with dummy data that doesn't consume your production credits.
</Note>

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
X-API-Key: your-api-key
```

Learn more about [authentication and obtaining API keys](/product-graph/authentication).

## Endpoint Categories

## Data Models

The API uses standardized data models across endpoints. Below are the key data structures you'll encounter:

### Product Model

```json
{
  "id": "prod_98765",
  "name": {
    "en": "Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones",
    "de": "Sony WH-1000XM4 Kabellose Noise-Cancelling-Kopfhörer"
  },
  "gtin": "4548736112001",
  "url": "https://example.com/products/sony-wh1000xm4",
  "price": 349.99,
  "brand": {
    "id": "brand_sony",
    "name": "Sony"
  },
  "content": {
    "description": {
      "en": "Industry-leading noise cancellation technology...",
      "de": "Branchenführende Geräuschunterdrückungstechnologie..."
    }
  }
}
```

### Brand Model

```json
{
  "id": "brand_sony",
  "name": "Sony",
  "searchable_aliases": ["sony corporation", "sony electronics"],
  "established": 1946,
  "headquarters": {
    "city": "Tokyo",
    "country": "Japan"
  },
  "logo_url": "https://example.com/logos/sony_logo_primary.svg"
}
```

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes and provides detailed error messages:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_language",
    "message": "The requested language 'xyz' is not supported.",
    "documentation_url": "https://productgraph.org/docs/errors#invalid_language",
    "request_id": "req_7a8b9c0d1e2f"
  }
}
```

For more information on handling errors, see the [Error Handling guide](/product-graph/error-handling).

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage. The limits depend on your plan tier. When you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response with a `Retry-After` header indicating how long to wait before retrying.

## OpenAPI Specification

Our API is fully documented with an OpenAPI specification. You can use this specification to generate client libraries, explore endpoints, and understand request and response formats.

## Using the API Playground

Throughout this reference, you'll find interactive API playgrounds where you can try each endpoint directly in your browser. To use these:

1. Enter the required parameters for the endpoint
2. Click "Run" to execute the request
3. View the response and headers
4. Copy the generated code for your preferred language
